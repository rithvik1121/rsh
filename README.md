# rsh
A simple shell written in Rust.

This project began as a shell written in C for one of my classes. The plan is to maintain parity between the shell I write for class and this shell until the class ends. I will add more features to this shell as I see fit, and ultimately hope to make this my main shell. I'm not too sure about what's to come for this project, since I'm just kinda doing whatever I feel like.
